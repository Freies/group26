## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

## Felix

```{r}
"HELLO Guys"
"test"
"test2"
```

## Jos√©

```{r}
#helloo

2*2

print(2)


```

## Emilie

```{r}
print('Hello')
 
x <- 2+2
s
```

## Sahandyz
